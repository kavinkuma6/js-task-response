Task - 1:
    We need to add this domain https://www.googletagmanager.com to the Content Security Policy to load the js file from this domain.
    Because, the js file is loaded from a differnt domain and it was not added to the CSP earlier.
    For Example: 
            <meta
            http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
            content="script-src 'self' https://www.googletagmanager.com 'unsafe-inline'"
            />

Task - 2:
    Safari browsers does not support 'strict-dynamic'.
    So, we need to use nonce as fallbacks like this: 
        <meta
        http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
        content="script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'self' 'nonce-abcdef' 'strict-dynamic'"
        />
    And, we have to add this nonce id(abcdef) to the script.


Task - 3:
    Yes, we could get errors on CSP for a font file. 
    Because font file can also be loaded from differnt sources. 
    If we didn't mention the sources in the CSP, it will result in error.
